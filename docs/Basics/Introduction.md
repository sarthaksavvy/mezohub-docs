We are always improving our service, so if you find any flaws or notice any areas for improvement, please contact us at featurerequest@mizohub.com.


## How does this work?
After selecting and adding your preferred server provider, you just create a new server from within mizo, and it will configure the server for you.

You can specify whether you want to utilise your server as a webserver, database server, email server, or load balancer, and Mizo will handle the rest.

You can specify which server you want to utilise based on your needs.
 - Apache/Nginx web server
 - PHP (including multiple version support)
 - Database (MySQL, Postgres, sqlite,Redis or MariaDB)
 - Firewall
 - Cache
 - Memcached
 - MeiliSearch
 
And a lot more!
