# Source Control
Introduction

Mezo can access your project's codebase using source providers, allowing for continuous and easy deployment of your applications. Mezo currently supports github and gitlab, however we are planning to add other git providers.

### Supported Providers
 - GitHub
 - Gitlab
 - Bitbucket

### Using A Custom Git Provider
 - Coming soon

## Manage your Provider
    
### Connecting Providers
    You can connect to any of the providers listed in the source control option on your dashboard.

### Unlinking Providers
    Coming soon.

### Re-Connect your account.
    You may need to refresh your token from the git service provider from time to time. It is quite simple to do with mezo. Simply go to Dashboard and control the source. On your linked account, you should notice a "Re-connect" button.
