# Add Projects to your server

You currently host Laravel and Node.js app to your servers.

### Create a New Project

To begin building a project on your server, click the New Project button. Simply explain the project name, type of project, database type, and php. Now select the github repo you want to deploy and you're set to go. Now click the submit button to finish. Mizo will install everything for you instantly.
